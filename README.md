# Face_Detection
# This face detection is based on LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) Face Recognizer.
 Firstly , some images of different persons are stored in their respective folder inside the root folder training_folder.
 Laptop webcam clicks a picture and matches with the trained data and recognizes the face
 If the face gets recognized or matches with existing faces, then his/her attendance will be upgraded or increased by 1.
 else if the face can not be recognized, "Face Not Found/Recognized" message appears on the output window
 
 This is a basic facial recognition base attendance system or can be used for security reasons too.
